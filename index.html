    <p>
      "Look at the stars. Th great kings of the past look down on us form those
       stars... So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will
       always be there to guide you. And so will I."

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>
      Mufasa, the king of Pride Rock has a son, Simba, making his brother Scar
      second in line to the throne. Scar hatches a plot to kill Mufasa and Simba,
      but when Simba survives, he convinces him that Mufasa's death was his
      fault, forcing Simba to run away. Simba grows up in the wilderness with a
      life of no worries. However, when he is reunited with a childhood friend,
      he is forced to go back and confront his uncle.
      <span class="spoiler-protect">After a battle between the two, it is
      revealed that Scar was responsible for Mufasa's death. Scar then causes
      his own death by leaping at Simbas as his back is turned but, instead of
      killing Simba, he gets thrown off of a cliff like Mufasa was.</span>
